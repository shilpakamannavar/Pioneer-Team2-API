# Pioneer-Team2-API

ABC company has a fleet of support team members managing hundreds of production applications. Every
incident is governed by strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to address in a stipulated time. Team members meticulously document every incident that happens in the system in the Microsoft Word application. New team members are onboarded recently, overwhelmed to see many troubleshooting documents and observed repetitive steps in multiple documents. Although documents help resolving issues, identifying the correct document is cumbersome in the given SLA time. The company has decided to implement a search engine that fetches the proper document based on a keyword or full-text search. 


This project help them to find the required document quickly.
There is a generic search text field that matches the string with the content, meta data like Author, Content type, Path , file extensions, Createion Date, People, Organizations, Locations, Key Phrases, Language, Masked Text.
